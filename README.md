__[√Æles]__ is a static-site generator that provides automatic [partial hydration].

Use [Vue] and [MDX] to build your website, while enjoying the smooth development
experience provided by [Vite.js].

When building for production, use directives to specify which components are
interactive, and [√Æles] will take care of shipping the minimal amount of JS needed.

__[Live Demo]__

## Features ‚ú®

- üèù Automatic [Partial Hydration]
  
  Ship JS only for the interactive bits, by default that's zero.

- ‚ö°Ô∏è Powered by [Vite.js]

  That means the server starts fast, and HMR feels instant.

- üìñ Great [MDX] Support
  
  Use components inside markdown. With HMR, the browser becomes a live preview.

- üß± Layouts and [Components][unplugin-vue-components]
  
  Use Vue components as layouts for Markdown or Vue pages.

- üõ£ [File-system Based Routing][vite-plugin-pages]

- üõ† Vue [Devtools][devtools1] [Support][devtools2]

## Project Status

‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha. If you are reading this, you probably arrived here too early.

The roadmap is ambitious though üòÑ

## Installation üíø

```bash
npm install iles # OR yarn add iles
```

## Usage üöÄ

The `iles` executable provides two commands, `serve` and `build`.

Add the following shortcuts to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "iles --open",
    "build": "iles build",
    "preview": "vite preview --open"
  },
```

- <kbd>npm run dev</kbd>: start the development server
- <kbd>npm run build</kbd>: create a production build of the site

### Default App Structure üìÇ

```ts
src/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
  ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ posts/
  ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ intro.mdx
  ‚îÇ  ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ goodbye.mdx
  ‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ about.mdx
  ‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ feed.vue
  ‚îÇ
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
  ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ReadingTime.vue
  ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Author.vue
  ‚îÇ
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ layouts/
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ default.vue
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ posts.vue
```

Components are auto-imported, but if you decide to add helpers or logic, you can
use `~/` which is aliased to the `src` dir. For example:

```ts
import { useDark } from '~/logic/dark'
```

## Hydration Directives üèù

You can define which components should remain interactive in the production
build by using `client:` directives in your components (borrowed from [Astro]).

Any JS required for these components will be automatically inferred and optimized to perform partial hydration in the final build.

> No JS is shipped for components without a hydration directive! üèù

Here's an example with MDX, an interactive audio player in a mostly static page:

```mdx
---
title: Song for You
audio: /song-for-you.mp3
---

I've recently recorded a song, listen:

<AudioPlayer {...frontmatter} client:visible/>
```

You can also use these directives inside your Vue components. In the following
example, the _Download_ link is rendered statically, while the `<Audio>`
component is interactive and will be hydrated when visible.

```vue
<template>
  <div class="audio-player">
    <Audio client:visible :src="audio" :initialDuration="initialDuration"/>
    <div>
      <a :href="audio" :download="`${title}.mp3`">
        Download the Song 
      </a>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
```

### Hydration Strategies üèù

The following hydration strategies are available.

- `client:load`
  Hydrates the component immediately as the page loads.

- `client:idle`
  Hydrate the component as soon as the main thread is [free][requestIdleCallback].

- `client:visible`
  Hydrates the component as soon as the element [enters the viewport][intersectionobserver].

- `client:media`
  Hydrates the component as soon as the browser [matches the given media query][matchMedia].

  Useful to avoid unnecessary work depending on the available viewport, such as in mobile devices.

- `client:only`
  Does not prerender the component during build. It's usually better to use one of the previous strategies, as it could create a flash of content.

## Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

You can configure Vite.js as [usual](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

Alternatively, you can configure [√Æles] using an `iles.config.ts` file:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'iles'

import iconsResolver from 'unplugin-icons/resolver'

import icons from 'unplugin-icons/vite'
import windicss from 'vite-plugin-windicss'

export default defineConfig({
  vite: {
    plugins: [
      icons(),
      windicss(),
    ],
  },
  components: {
    resolvers: [iconsResolver({ componentPrefix: '' })],
  },
  pages: {
    extendRoute (route) {
      if (route.path.startsWith('/posts'))
        return { ...route, meta: { layout: 'post', ...route.meta } }
    },
  },
})
```

To configure the app, you may use `src/app.ts`:

```ts
import { defineApp } from 'iles'

export default defineApp({
  head: {
    title: 'Site Title',
    meta: [
      { property: 'description', content: 'Site Description.' },
    ],
  },
  enhanceApp ({ app, head, router }) {
    // Configure the app to add plugins.
  },
})
```

You can use TypeScript autocompletion to discover available options.
