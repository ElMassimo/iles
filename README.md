```

pnpm build
```

And you will see the generated files in `dist`, and some of these files will be moved to `serverless` for deployment.

### Deploy on Vercel

Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and install its CLI. Then:

```bash
pnpm preview # Simulate Vercel environment locally
pnpm deploy
pnpm deploy:prod
```

## Why

I have created several Vite apps recently. Setting the configs up is kinda the bottleneck for me to make the ideas simply come true within a very short time.

So I made this starter template for myself to create apps more easily, along with some good practices that I have learned from making those apps. It's strongly opinionated, but feel free to tweak it or even maintains your own forks. [(see community maintained variation forks)](#variations)
