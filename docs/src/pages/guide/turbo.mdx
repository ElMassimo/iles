# Turbo (Experimental) üöÄ

<Iles/> provides an __experimental__ <kbd>[turbo]</kbd> mode that enables SPA-like navigation.

It combines techniques from [`quicklink`][quicklink] and [`@hotwired/turbo`][hotwired], but taking advantage of the architecture of every <Iles/> site to achieve it in __under 2kb__.

You can see it in action in [this site][docs config]!

## How it Works üîç

- Links in the viewport are detected and prefetched like in [`quicklink`][quicklink]
- When a link is clicked, the head and body are replaced using the prefetched html, like in [`@hotwired/turbo`][hotwired]
- Any islands in the previous page are unmounted, islands in the new page are hydrated as needed

<Tip title="Caveats" warn>
- All `script type="module"` [execute once][modules]
- For islands, use the lifecycle of each component as usual (`onMounted`, `onUnmounted`)
- In [client scripts], use the `onLoad` callback for effects that should run on every page load
- Code __outside__ components or callbacks won't run on each page navigation
- Add the `once` attribute to non-module scripts that should only execute once
</Tip>

<Tip title="Roadmap üõ£">
It's possible to avoid unmounting islands that don't change from one page navigation to the other, making them automatically "permanent" (in the `@hotwired/turbo` terminology) without any intervention from the user.

That would allow persistent components typically found in SPAs like shopping carts to work seamlessly.
