# Deployment ðŸš€

This section contains useful information for building and deploying an <Iles/> application.

> Pull requests to add other providers are welcome!

## Build ðŸ“¦

To build your site, run <kbd>npm run build</kbd> if you used the [starter], or
manually add a `"build": "iles build",` script to your `package.json`.

Like [Vite.js], the default output dir is <kbd>/dist</kbd>.

## Netlify <NetlifyLogo/>

Add a `netlify.toml` file to your project:

```toml
[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "16"
  
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npm run build"
``` 

Then, push to your git repository [as usual](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/get-started/).

<Tip title="pnpm">
If using `pnpm`, make sure to install dependencies:

```toml
[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "16"
  NPM_FLAGS = "--version"

[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npx pnpm i --store=node_modules/.pnpm-store && npx pnpm run build"
``` 
</Tip>

## Vercel <VercelLogo/>

Add a `vercel.json` file to your project to match the behavior of Vue Router:

```json
{
  "cleanUrls": true,
  "trailingSlash": false
}
```

Then, push to your git repository [as usual](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git).

## GitHub Pages <GitHubLogo/>

To deploy in GitHub Pages, add a workflow like the following using <kbd>[actions-gh-pages]</kbd>:

```yml
name: Deploy Ã®les site

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 16.x

      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v1.2.1
        with:
          version: 5.13.6
          run_install: |
            - recursive: false

      - name: Build Site
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy Site
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./dist
```
<Caption><code>.github/workflows/deploy.yml</code></Caption>

The example above assumes `pnpm`, but you can use a different package manager
and adjust the workflow accordingly.

Read the <kbd>[actions-gh-pages]</kbd> docs for more information on configuration,
and make sure to [manually enable `gh-pages`][actions] if it's the [first deployment][actions] with `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
