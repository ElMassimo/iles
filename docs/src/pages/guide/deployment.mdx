# Deployment ðŸš€

This section contains useful information for building and deploying an <Iles/> application.

> Pull requests to add other providers are welcome!

## Build ðŸ“¦

To build your site, run <kbd>npm run build</kbd> if you used the [starter], or
manually add a `"build": "iles build",` script to your `package.json`.

Like [Vite.js], the default output dir is <kbd>/dist</kbd>.

## Netlify <NetlifyLogo/>

Add a `netlify.toml` file to your project:

```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npm run build"
``` 

Then, push to your git repository [as usual](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/get-started/).

<Tip title="pnpm">
If using `pnpm`, make sure to install dependencies:

```toml
[build.environment]
  NPM_FLAGS = "--version"

[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npx pnpm i --store=node_modules/.pnpm-store && npx pnpm run build"
``` 
</Tip>
