# Deployment ðŸš€

This section contains useful information for building and deploying an <Iles/> application.

> Pull requests to add other providers are welcome!

## Build ðŸ“¦

If you used the [starter], the default configuration to [build](/guide#usage) your site is:

- __Build Command__: <kbd>npm run build</kbd>
- __Output Directory__: <kbd>dist</kbd>

Else, you could manually add a `"build": "iles build",` script to your `package.json`.

Like in most [Vite.js] projects, the default output dir is <kbd>/dist</kbd>.

## pnpm

[pnpm] is not supported out of the box in most providers, but you can still use it.

In most cases, that requires manually installing dependencies by prepending an install
command to the configured __Build Command__:

```bash
npx pnpm i --store=node_modules/.pnpm-store && npx pnpm run build
```

## Cloudflare Pages <CloudflareLogo/>

To deploy in Cloudflare Pages, you will need to [create a project](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/get-started) and configure:

- __Build Command__: <kbd>npm run build</kbd>
- __Output Directory__: <kbd>dist</kbd>

Additionally, since the default version of node is `12.18.0`, you will need to
set the `NODE_VERSION` environment variable to `14.18.1` or higher.

## Netlify <NetlifyLogo/>

Add a `netlify.toml` file to your project:

```toml
[build]
  publish = "dist"
  command = "npm run build"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "16"
  # NPM_FLAGS = "--version" # uncomment if using pnpm to skip npm install
``` 

Then, push to your git repository [as usual](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/get-started/).

## Vercel <VercelLogo/>

Add a `vercel.json` file to your project to match the behavior of Vue Router:

```json
{
  "cleanUrls": true,
  "trailingSlash": false
}
```

Alternatively, you can disable <kbd>[prettyUrls]</kbd>, which will explicitly
add `.html` in link hrefs, and trailing slashes on index html files.

Then, push to your git repository [as usual](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/git).

## GitHub Pages <GitHubLogo/>

To deploy in GitHub Pages, add a workflow like the following using <kbd>[actions-gh-pages]</kbd>:

```yml
name: Deploy Ã®les site

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Use Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 16.x

      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v1.2.1
        with:
          version: 6.10.3
          run_install: |
            - recursive: false

      - name: Build Site
        run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy Site
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./dist
```
<Caption><code>.github/workflows/deploy.yml</code></Caption>

The example above assumes `pnpm`, but you can use a different package manager
and adjust the workflow accordingly.

Read the <kbd>[actions-gh-pages]</kbd> docs for more information on configuration,
and make sure to [manually enable `gh-pages`][actions] if it's the [first deployment][actions] with `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

## Buddy <BuddyLogo />
You can deploy **Iles** using [Buddy](https://buddy.works), a CI/CD solution that can build your site and push it to many different deploy targets including FTP servers and cloud hosting providers.

Buddy itself will not host your site. Instead, it helps you manage the build process and deliver the result to a deploy platform of your choice.
1. Create a Buddy account [here](https://buddy.works).
2. Create a new project and connect it with a git repository (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, any private Git Repository or you can use Buddy Git Hosting).
3. Add a new pipeline.
4. In the newly created pipeline add a [Node.js](https://buddy.works/actions/node-js) action.
5. In this action add:
```
npm install
npm run build
```

Of course, you can use `yarn` or `pnpm` if you prefer it.
6. Add a deployment action â€” there are many to choose from, you can browse them [here](https://buddy.works/actions). Although their settings can differ, remember to set the Source path to dist.
7. Press the **Run** button.
