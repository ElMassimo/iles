# Introduction

<Iles/> is a __static-site generator__ that provides great support for __[partial hydration][hydration]__.

Use [Vue] and [MDX][markdown] to build your website, while enjoying the smooth development
experience provided by [Vite.js].

When building for production, use [`client` directives][hydration] to specify which components are interactive, and automatically ship the minimal amount of JS needed.

<Tip title="Live Demos">
This site is [built][docs repo] with <Iles/>, as well as [this port of the Vue.js blog][demo] ([repo][blog repo]).
</Tip>

## Features ‚ú®

### üèù [Partial Hydration][hydration]
  
  Ship JS only for the interactive bits, by default that's zero.

  [Islands][hydration] can be defined using [Vue][vue plugin], [Preact], [SolidJS], [Svelte], or [vanilla JS].

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Powered by [Vite.js]

  That means the server starts fast, and HMR feels instant.

### üìñ Great [Markdown] Support
  
  Use components inside [markdown]. With HMR, the browser becomes a live preview.

### üß± [Layouts] and [Components]
  
  Use Vue components as [layouts] for Markdown or Vue pages.

  No need to import [components], it just works, even in [markdown].

### üõ£ [File-Based Routing][pages]

  Routes are generated by default based on your [pages], but you can configure them as needed.

### üõ† Vue [Devtools][devtools1] [Support][devtools2]

  See frontmatter and metadata for the current page, and debug islands hydration.
