# Introduction

<Iles/> is a static-site generator that provides automatic [partial hydration].

Use [Vue] and [MDX] to build your website, while enjoying the smooth development
experience provided by [Vite.js].

When building for production, use [`client` directives][hydration] to specify which components are interactive, and automatically ship the minimal amount of JS needed.

## Features ✨

### 🏝 Automatic [Partial Hydration]
  
  Ship JS only for the interactive bits, by default that's zero.

### ⚡️ Powered by [Vite.js]

  That means the server starts fast, and HMR feels instant.

### 📖 Great [MDX] Support
  
  Use components inside markdown. With HMR, the browser becomes a live preview.

### 🧱 Layouts and [Components][unplugin-vue-components]
  
  Use Vue components as layouts for Markdown or Vue pages.

### 🛣 [File-system Based Routing][vite-plugin-pages]

### 🛠 Vue [Devtools][devtools1] [Support][devtools2]
