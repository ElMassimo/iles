# Client Scripts

Sometimes you need client-side code that does not map to a component.

There are two main ways to achieve this in <Iles/>.

## Client Script Block <VueLogo/>

<Iles/> provides support for a `script client` block in Vue single-file components.

```vue
<script client:load lang="ts">
console.log('Powered by √Æles üèù', 'https://iles-docs.netlify.app')
</script>
```

<Tip warn>
Client script blocks are completely detached from the Vue component, which will be statically pre-rendered. The [strategy] is applied to the script, __not__ the component.
</Tip>

The script will be injected every time the component is rendered, and it's
guaranteed to execute after all elements rendered by the component are in the DOM.

```vue
<script client:load lang="ts">
document.getElementById('sidebar').classList.toggle('live') // always works
</script>

<template>
  <div id="sidebar"/>
</template>
```

> If you need code to execute once, use `script client` in a [layout].

### Execution Strategies <Logo/>

Other [strategies] that we saw in the [previous section] are supported,
but you must export `onLoad`.

This function will be called when the condition for the selected strategy is met‚Äîwhen the element becomes visible if using `client:visible`, when the media query matches if using `client:media`, etc.

```vue
<script client:visible lang="ts">
console.log('Not necessarily visible')

export function onLoad () {
  console.log('Now visible')
}
</script>
```

## Vanilla Components üç¶

`.js` and `.ts` files can also be used as client scripts in <Iles/>, and you can
choose where to place them by rendering them as islands.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import GalleryPreloader from '~/logic/imagePreloader' // .ts
</script>

<template>
  <GalleryPreloader client:visible/>
  ...
</template>
```

<Tip warn>
You must provide a `client:` [strategy] when using vanilla components.
</Tip>

Vanilla components should export a function to call when the selected
[hydration strategy][strategy] is fulfilled.

```ts
export const onLoad = () => fetch('/images').then(...)
```

If you need to use the provided parameters, use the `OnLoadFn` typings:

```ts
import type { OnLoadFn } from 'iles'

export const onLoad: OnLoadFn = (el, props, slots) => {
  // Do whatever you need with the element.
}
```

<Tip title="Why not use a renderless component?">
The benefit is that vanilla JS doesn't require a runtime, so the final
bundle size will be smaller.

If your app [already has islands with a framework][frameworks], then use whatever you find more natural.
</Tip>
