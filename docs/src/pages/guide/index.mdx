## Installation 💿

Run the following command to create a new îles project.

```bash
pnpm init iles@next # or npm or yarn
```

The [starter] comes with Vue components and examples. Once you have installed
all dependencies, give it a try by running <kbd>npm run dev</kbd> to start the
development server.

Alternatively, add `iles` to your `package.json` in an existing project.

## Usage 🚀

The `iles` executable provides two commands, `serve` and `build`.

- <kbd>iles serve</kbd>: Starts the development server
- <kbd>iles build</kbd>: Creates a production build of the site

The following shortcuts are added by default when using the [starter]:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "iles --open",
    "build": "iles build",
    "preview": "vite preview --open"
  },
```

- <kbd>npm run dev</kbd>: Starts the development server
- <kbd>npm run build</kbd>: Creates a production build of the site
