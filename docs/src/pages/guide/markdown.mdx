# Markdown ðŸ“–

<Iles/> provides excellent support for [`.mdx`][mdx] files thanks to <kbd>[xdm]</kbd>, allowing you to use Vue components inside markdown, and use markdown components in Vue.

## What is [MDX]?

[MDX] is a format that combines JSX and Markdown, allowing you to embed
components in markdown, and pass markdown-rendered content to the component slots.

```mdx
---
date: 2020-10-14
---

## Vue in Markdown <VueLogo/>

<Iles/> combines [Vue JSX] and [XDM] and enables you to use Vue components
in MDX files.

in MDX files.

HMR is fully supported, and components can be used [without importing them][components]. 

### Binding Dynamic Values

The syntax of MDX is different from Vue templates when it comes to binding dynamic values.

Instead of `:title="frontmatter.title"`, you would do `title={frontmatter.title}`

```mdx
<Tip title={frontmatter.title}>
You can access the document's `frontmatter`, and `meta` info injected by <Iles/>.

For example, last updated on { meta.lastUpdated.toLocaleDateString('en-US') }.
</Tip>
```

<Tip title={frontmatter.title}>
You can access the document's [`frontmatter`][frontmatter], and `meta` info injected by <Iles/>.

For example, last updated on { meta.lastUpdated.toLocaleDateString('en-US') }.
</Tip>

### Markdown in Slots

Components can receive markdown content using slots:

```mdx
<Tip title="Markdown in Slots">
This is a _markdown-based_ comment. **Great!**
</Tip>
```

<Tip title="Markdown in Slots">
This is a _markdown-based_ comment. **Great!**
</Tip>

### Multiple Slots

If you need several slots, you can use `v-slot` or provide an [object slot][vue-jsx]:

```mdx
<Tip warn v-slots={{ title: () => <span>But better keep it <b>simple</b></span> }}>
The syntax is confusing, and you can often achieve the same using props.
</Tip>
```

## Markdown in Vue <VueLogo/>

Markdown files can be used as Vue components, and they will be automatically
imported if they are placed in the [components] dir.

```vue
<script setup>
import Acknowledgements from '~/components/Acknowledgements.mdx' // not needed
</script>

<template>
  <Acknowledgements/>
</template>
```

They can also be used in MDX files as components, which is the easiest way to
reuse footers or sections that are repeated across documents.

```mdx
import Acknowledgements from '~/components/Acknowledgements.mdx' // not needed

And _without_ further ado:

<Acknowledgements/>
```

## Frontmatter and Meta ðŸ“ƒ

In addition to [what we saw earlier][pages], in MDX files any frontmatter
properties can be referenced directly.

```mdx
---
title: Both of these
description: Will be available as variables in the component.
---

<Tip title={ title }>
  { description }
</Tip>
``` 

<Iles/> will also inject useful information, such as the page `href`, which you can access as `meta`.

```mdx
<SuggestChangesLink filename={ meta.filename }/>
```

When importing the component in Vue files, all of these properties are also
available in the module:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import doc from '~/pages/introduction.mdx'
</script>

<template>
  <h1>{{ doc.title }}</h1>
  <p>{{ doc.frontmatter.description }}</p>
  <span>Last Updated: {{ formatDate(doc.meta.lastUpdated) }}</span>>
</template>
```
