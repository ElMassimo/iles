# Markdown üìñ

<Iles/> provides excellent support for [`.mdx`][mdx] files thanks to <kbd>[xdm]</kbd>, allowing you to use [components][frameworks] inside markdown, and use markdown components in Vue.

## What is [MDX]?

[MDX] is a format that combines JSX and Markdown, allowing you to embed
components in markdown, and use markdown content inside component slots.

```mdx
---
date: 2020-10-14
---

# Markdown üìñ

<Iles/> provides excellent support for `.mdx` files thanks to <kbd>xdm</kbd>,
allowing you to use components inside markdown, and use markdown components
in Vue.

<Caption>The introduction of this MDX page.</Caption>

## Frontmatter and Meta üìÉ

<Iles/> exposes [frontmatter] properties so that they can be referenced directly in MDX.

```mdx
---
title: Both of these
description: Will be available as variables in the component.
---

<Tip title={ title }>
  { description }
</Tip>
```

If you need all properties, you can use the `frontmatter` object.

```mdx
<Summary { ...frontmatter }/>
```

The `filename` and the page `href` can be accessed through [`meta`][meta].

```mdx
<SuggestChangesLink filename={ meta.filename }/>
```

### Markdown Drafts üìù

You can mark an individual document as _unpublished_ by using `draft: true`.

```mdx
---
title: Still not ready
draft: true
---
```

By default, draft pages and documents will be displayed in development, but will be excluded when building the site. Use <kbd>[drafts]</kbd> to override this behavior.

## Components in Markdown üß±

<Iles/> extends [XDM] enabling you to use [components from different frameworks][frameworks] in MDX files.

HMR is fully supported, and components can be used [without importing them][components]. 

### Markdown in Slots

Components can receive markdown content using slots:

```mdx
<Tip title="Markdown in Slots">
This is a _markdown-based_ comment. **Great!**
</Tip>
```

<Tip title="Markdown in Slots">
This is a _markdown-based_ comment. **Great!**
</Tip>

### Binding Dynamic Values

The syntax of MDX is different from Vue templates when it comes to binding dynamic values.

Instead of `:title="example"`, you would do `title={example}`:

```mdx
export const example = 'Variables in Markdown'

<Tip title={example}>
You can access the document's `frontmatter`, and `meta` info injected by <Iles/>.

And use expressions, such as { meta.lastUpdated.toLocaleDateString('en-US') }.
</Tip>
```
export const example = 'Variables in Markdown'

<Tip title={example}>
You can access the document's `frontmatter`, and `meta` info injected by <Iles/>.

And use expressions, such as { meta.lastUpdated.toLocaleDateString('en-US') }.
</Tip>

## Markdown in Vue <VueLogo/>

Markdown files can be used as Vue components, and they will be automatically
imported if they are placed in the [components] dir.

```vue
<script setup>
import Acknowledgements from '~/components/Acknowledgements.mdx' // not needed
</script>

<template>
  <Acknowledgements/>
</template>
```

They can also be used in MDX files as components, which is the easiest way to
reuse footers or sections that are repeated across documents.

```jsx
import Acknowledgements from '~/components/Acknowledgements.mdx' // not needed

And _without_ further ado:

<Acknowledgements/>
```

### Rendering and Frontmatter

When importing an [MDX] component from Vue, you can render its content using [`<component>`][component], and access [`frontmatter` and `meta`](#frontmatter-and-meta) as properties in the module:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import doc from '~/pages/introduction.mdx'
</script>

<template>
  <h1>
    <a :href="doc.href">{{ doc.title }}</a>
  </h1>
  <p>{{ doc.frontmatter.description }}</p>
  <component :is="doc"/>
  <span>Last Updated: {{ formatDate(doc.meta.lastUpdated) }}</span>>
</template>
```

## Advanced: Override Elements (Shortcodes)

You can use any components from <kbd>[src/components][components]</kbd>
or those [globally registered in Vue][enhanceApp] without manually importing them in MDX.

If you would like to replace built-in tags such as `img` and `a` with
custom components, or provide other components, there are two main options.

### Override Components Globally

Use the <kbd>[mdxComponents]</kbd> option to override elements globally
in all MDX documents.

```ts
import ResponsiveImage from '~/components/ResponsiveImage.vue'

export default defineApp({
  mdxComponents: {
    img: ResponsiveImage,
  },
})
```
<Caption>`src/app.ts`</Caption>

<Tip title="Recommended ‚ú®">
Easy to setup, and provides consistency in how documents are rendered across the site.
</Tip>

### Override Components Explicitly 

If you need more control, you can use the `components` prop in MDX components.

```vue
<script setup>
import Introduction from '~/pages/introduction.mdx'

import Footer from '~/components/SpecialFooter.vue'

const components = { Footer }
</script>

<template>
  <h1>{{ Introduction.title }}</h1>
  <Introduction :components="components"/>
</template>
```

Use `provideMDXComponents` to override elements and components in all nested components. For example, to override components in all pages that use a specific layout:

```vue
<script setup>
import { provideMDXComponents } from 'iles'

import Footer from '~/components/PostFooter.vue'

provideMDXComponents({ Footer })
</script>

...
```
<Caption>`src/layouts/post.vue`</Caption>

## Advanced: Multiple Slots in MDX

If you need to provide several slots to a component in [MDX], you can use [`v-slots`][vue-jsx]:

```jsx
export const titleWithMarkdown = <span>But better keep it <b>simple</b></span>

<Tip warn v-slots={{ title: () => titleWithMarkdown }}>
The syntax is confusing, and you can often achieve the same using props.
</Tip>
```

export const titleWithMarkdown = <span>But better keep it <b>simple</b></span>

<Tip warn v-slots={{ title: () => titleWithMarkdown }}>
The syntax is confusing, and you can often achieve the same using props.
</Tip>
