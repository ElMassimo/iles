# Hydration Directives <Logo/>

You can define which components should remain interactive in the production
build by using `client:` directives in your components (borrowed from [Astro]).

Any JS required for these components will be automatically inferred and optimized to perform partial hydration in the final build.

> No JS is shipped unless you use a hydration strategy! 🏝

Here's an example with MDX, an interactive audio player in a mostly static page:

```mdx
---
title: Song for You
audio: /song-for-you.mp3
---

I've recently recorded a song, listen:

<AudioPlayer {...frontmatter} client:visible/>
```

You can also use these directives inside your Vue components. In the following
example, the _Download_ link is rendered statically, while the `<Audio>`
component is interactive and will be hydrated when visible.

```vue
<template>
  <div class="audio-player">
    <Audio client:visible :src="audio" :initialDuration="initialDuration"/>
    <div>
      <a :href="audio" :download="`${title}.mp3`">
        Download the Song
      </a>
    </div>
  </div>
</template>
```

The following hydration strategies are available.

## 🏝 client:load
Hydrates the component immediately as the page loads.

```vue
<DarkModeSwitch client:load/>
```

## 🏝 client:idle
Hydrate the component as soon as the main thread is [free][requestIdleCallback].

```vue
<TimeAgo :date="date" client:idle/>
```

## 🏝 client:visible
Hydrates the component as soon as the element [enters the viewport][intersectionobserver].

```vue
<AudioPlayer :src="/example.mp3" client:visible/>
```

## 🏝 client:media
Hydrates the component as soon as the browser [matches the given media query][matchMedia].

Useful to avoid unnecessary work depending on the available viewport, such as in mobile devices.

```vue
<Sidebar client:media="screen and (min-width: 600px)"/>
```

## 🏝 client:none
Does not hydrate the component in the client, it will be prerendered as static HTML.

<Tip warn>
Allows to detect [Preact], [SolidJS], or [Svelte] components embedded in Vue or MDX files.

__No JS will be shipped in the build.__
  
You can use any of the other directives if you want the component to be interactive.
</Tip>

## 🏝 client:only
Does not prerender the component during build.

<Tip warn>
Because it's not pre-rendered it could cause [layout shift] and affect the user experience.

Prefer one of the previous strategies whenever possible.
