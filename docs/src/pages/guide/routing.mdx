# Routing ðŸ›£

<Iles/> provides file-based routing, powered by [`vite-plugin-pages`](https://github.com/hannoeru/vite-plugin-pages).

As you add files to the <kbd>src/pages</kbd> directory, they will become
available as routes based on their filename, and [Vue Router] will be configured
automatically.

## Basic Routing

Each [page] file corresponds to a route with the same name:

- `src/pages/about.vue` -> `/about`
- `src/pages/introduction.mdx` -> `/introduction`
- `src/pages/users/profile.vue` -> `/users/profile`

## Index Routes

Files with the name `index` are treated as the index page of a route:

- `src/pages/index.vue` -> `/`
- `src/pages/users/index.vue` -> `/users`

## Aliased Routes

If you want the same component to be rendered as different pages, you can use
[Vue Router]'s `alias` in [frontmatter]:

```vue
<route>
alias: ['/posts']
</route>
```

## Override Routes

You can also override the default structure by providing `path` in [frontmatter]:

```mdx
---
path: /guide/intro
---
```

## Dynamic Routes

<Iles/> supports _dynamic parameters_ in the filename, so that one [page]
can be used to generate many different paths based on custom logic.

<Tip warn>
Pages with dynamic parameters must define <kbd>[getStaticPaths]</kbd>.
</Tip>

### Named Parameters

Named parameters are denoted using square brackets:

- `src/pages/posts/[slug].vue` -> `/posts/:slug`, __example__: `/posts/introduction`

### Rest Parameters

Catch-all routes are denoted with square brackets containing an ellipsis:

- `src/pages/[...all].vue` -> `/:all(.*)*`, __example__: `/a/dynamic/path`

The text after the ellipsis will be used both to name the route, and as the name
of the prop in which the route parameters are passed.

## `getStaticPaths`

[Pages] with dynamic params must provide a `getStaticPaths` function.

`getStaticPaths` should return an array of objects to determine which paths should be
statically generated at build time.

<Tip>
It must be specified in the default export of a Vue component, you may use the
`definePageComponent` helper to provide intellisense.
</Tip>

```vue
<script lang="ts">
import { definePageComponent } from 'iles'

export default definePageComponent({
  getStaticPaths () {
    return [
      { params: { section: 'one' }, props: { message: '...' } },
      { params: { section: 'two' }, props: { message: '...' } },
    ]
  ],
})
</script>

<script setup lang="ts">
defineProps<{ message: string }>()
</script>

<template>
  <p>{{ message }}</p>
</template>
```
<Caption>`src/pages/dynamic/[section].vue`</Caption>


See the generated examples: [one](/dynamic/one) and [two](/dynamic/two).

### `params`

The `params` key of each path will be used to resolve any named and rest parameters in the [page] filename, similar to how you would provide named parameters when using [Vue Router].

You can access them in the [page] component using `$route.params`, or by specifying them
in `defineProps`.

### `props`

You can pass additional data to each generated page by using `props` in each
path object, and they will be provided as props in the [page] component.

You can access them using `defineProps` as in the example above, or as `props` in `usePage`.
