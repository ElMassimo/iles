# Supported Frameworks üß±

Components from the following frameworks can be embedded in Vue and [MDX files] in <Iles/>:

- [Preact]
- [SolidJS]
- [Svelte]
- [Vanilla JS]

<Tip warn>
You must add a [hydration directive][hydration] when using these components in Vue and [MDX files].
</Tip>

> No JS is shipped if you use <kbd>[client:none]</kbd> üèù

## Choosing a Framework ü§î

While Vue is the natural choice given that pages and layouts in <Iles/> are Vue components,
you might want to use a framework with a smaller runtime for the [interactive bits][hydration].

For efficiency, you would want all islands to use the same framework, to offset
the size of the runtime.

But before you leave and continue building your site‚Ä¶

## Performance is Not Everything!

Several factors come into play when making this decision, such as development and maintenance costs.

For example, in the navbar of this site there are two islands:

```vue
<div class="flex items-center pl-6">
  <DocSearch client:idle/>
  <DarkModeSwitch client:load/>
</div>
```

- `<DocSearch>` is a [Preact] component.

  It's the heaviest component in this site, but I didn't have to build an accessible modal that works flawlessly in all devices and integrates with Algolia's search indexes.

- `<DarkModeSwitch/>` is a [Vue] component

  It leverages <kbd>[useDark]</kbd> from `@vueuse/core`, and uses a Vue `<transition>` when toggling the icon.

  It could be recreated using Svelte without additional dependencies, but the
  difference in bundle size for this site would be negligible, while risking the
  chance of introducing bugs.

<Tip title="Which framework should you choose?">
It depends on the situation! There's no right answer or single metric to consider.
</Tip>

## Bundle Size üìä

The following is a summary of [the conclusions of a recent analysis][size comparison] that compares the final bundle size after adding the size of the framework runtime to the size of the compiled components:

<Tip title="If the amount of interactive components per page is">
- `less than 3` ‚Äî use [Svelte] to get the smallest bundle size
- `between 3 and 10` ‚Äî you could give [SolidJS] a try
- `more than 10` ‚Äî [Preact] is a reasonable choice
</Tip>

<Tip title="But that's just what one benchmark concluded!" warn>
Do your own measurements, and as mentioned previously, there are
often more important factors than bundle size. Choose according to your project's
circumstances.
</Tip>
