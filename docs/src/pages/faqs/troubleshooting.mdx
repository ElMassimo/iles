# Troubleshooting

This section lists a few common gotchas, and bugs introduced in the past.

Please skim through __before__ opening an [issue][GitHub Issues].

## Page data not properly injected in app

`usePage` can not be used inside islands, as it would cause the entire context
(page, frontmatter, meta) to be included in the bundle.

Instead, pass the necessary data explicitly as props. For example:

```vue
<TimeAgo :date="$meta.lastUpdated" client:visible/>
```

## Could not load layout file during build

[Layout file names must be lowercase][layout]: `default.vue` instead of `Default.vue`.

Most [service providers][deployment] are Linux-based, which is case-sensitive.
This is why it might work in your local macOS or Windows, but fail when [deploying][deployment].
