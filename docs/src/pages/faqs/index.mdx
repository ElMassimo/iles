# FAQs

This section addresses common questions that people have when they found about <Iles/>.

<Should/>

## What's with the [islands]? <Iles noText heading/>

The term has gained some popularity lately, as a metaphor for a mostly static
page (the sea), sprinkled with interactive sections (the [islands]).

Since [Vue] is the _The Progressive JavaScript Framework_, what
better foundation for a library that makes it super easy to perform [progressive hydration][hydration]? üòÉ<VueLogo/>

With <Iles/> the page is pre-rendered just like in SSR, but JS is only shipped
for the interactive bits as needed, which optimizes bundle size and page load time.

## Motivation ü§î

I started working on <Iles/> because I wanted [Vitepress] + [Astro] using <ViteLogo/> instead of Snowpack.

Currently, my goal is to provide the smoothest integration with Vue and Vite.js
plugins so that you can iterate swiftly as you build your site or app, while
using [components from any frameworks][frameworks] to avoid reinventing the wheel
and focus on shipping value.

## Comparisons ‚öñÔ∏è

<Iles/> builds upon the ideas of old and new frameworks for static-site generation.

> Pull requests to add more comparisons are welcome!

### [Vitepress]

Love Vitepress! Highly recommend it for most documentation websites. This site
uses <Iles/> mostly for dogfooding purposes.

The main difference is that <Iles/> supports [partial hydration][hydration], so
you can ship JS only for the interactive parts of the page.

Currently, partial hydration in Vitepress is a manual process, and its default
mode is targeted at building single-page applications.

Vitepress has an MPA mode that can ship no JS. In <Iles/> that happens
automatically if you don't use [hydration directives][hydration].

<Tip>
Use Vitepress if you are building a documentation website, don't need [partial hydration][hydration], or if it has to be a single-page application.
</Tip>

### [Astro]

The main inspiration for [partial hydration][hydration] in <Iles/>.

Now that Astro is moving to Vite.js, the differences will become smaller.

The following is a list of features and differences to help you compare:

- Astro uses an .astro file format. In √Æles you use [Vue or MDX pages](/guide/development#pages)
- √Æles provides an [inspector panel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1158253/133314267-f0ba784c-ff64-4ee8-b2bf-97ecffc2facd.jpg) in Vue devtools to inspect page data and [hydration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1158253/133314279-1edc22d1-3ffb-414e-b994-212cb316593b.jpg)
- Pages in √Æles have access to [frontmatter and file metadata](/guide/development#using-page-data)
- You can [glob import](/guide/development#glob-imports) pages in √Æles, access their frontmatter, and render them
- √Æles provides [auto-import for components](/guide/development#components) in Vue and MDX files
- Astro provides support for pagination. √Æles doesn't have a similar concept
- √Æles supports a [convenient syntax for layouts](/guide/development#layouts). In Astro you manually import and use components as layouts
- Astro supports paths with dynamic params. √Æles does not support this _yet_
- √Æles has a very refined HMR, even site-wide data is automatically reloaded

<Tip>
Use Astro if you need dynamic routes or pagination.

For other sites, it's mostly a matter of taste.
