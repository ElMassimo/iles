# FAQs

This section addresses common questions that people have when they found about <Iles/>.

## What's with the [islands]? <Iles noText heading/>

The term has gained some popularity lately, as a metaphor for a mostly static
page (the sea), sprinkled with interactive sections (the [islands]).

With <Iles/> the page is pre-rendered just like in server-side rendering, but JS
is automatically added for the interactive bits, making it easier to use than
manually attaching JS to existing elements, and more optimal than hydrating the
entire page.

## Motivation ü§î

I started working on <Iles/> because I wanted [Vitepress] + [Astro] using <ViteLogo/> instead of Snowpack.

<Iles/> philosophy is to provide a smooth integration with Vite.js and its
wonderful plugin ecosystem, while enabling the use of [components from any frameworks][frameworks] so that you can focus on shipping value.

## Comparisons ‚öñÔ∏è

<Iles/> builds upon the ideas of old and new frameworks for static-site generation.

### [Vitepress] <ViteLogo/>

Love Vitepress! Highly recommend it for most documentation websites. This site
uses <Iles/> mostly for dogfooding purposes.

The main difference is that <Iles/> supports [partial hydration][hydration], so
you can ship JS only for the interactive parts of the page. Currently, partial
hydration in Vitepress is a manual process, and its default mode is targeted at
building single-page applications.

Vitepress has an MPA mode to strip away all JS. In <Iles/> that happens
automatically if you don't use [hydration directives][hydration].

<Tip>
Use Vitepress if you are building a documentation website, don't need [partial hydration][hydration], or if it has to be a single-page application.
</Tip>

### [Astro] <AstroLogo/>

Astro is the main inspiration for [partial hydration][hydration] in <Iles/>.

Now that Astro is moving to Vite.js, the differences will become smaller.

The following is a list of features and differences to help you compare:

- Astro uses an .astro file format. In <Iles small/> you use [Vue or MDX pages](/guide/development#pages)
- <Iles small/> provides an [inspector panel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1158253/133314267-f0ba784c-ff64-4ee8-b2bf-97ecffc2facd.jpg) in Vue devtools to inspect page data and [hydration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1158253/133314279-1edc22d1-3ffb-414e-b994-212cb316593b.jpg)
- Pages in <Iles small/> have access to [frontmatter and file metadata](/guide/development#using-page-data)
- You can [glob import](/guide/development#glob-imports) pages in <Iles small/>, access their frontmatter, and render them
- <Iles small/> provides [auto-import for components](/guide/development#components) in Vue and MDX files
- Astro provides support for pagination. <Iles small/> doesn't have a similar concept
- <Iles small/> supports a [convenient syntax for layouts](/guide/development#layouts). In Astro you manually import and use components as layouts
- Astro supports paths with dynamic params. <Iles small/> does not support this _yet_
- <Iles small/> has a very refined HMR, even site-wide data is automatically reloaded

<Tip>
Use Astro if you need dynamic routes or pagination.

For other sites, it's mostly a matter of taste.
